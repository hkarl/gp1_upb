* Notes for installation 

- one server 
- with group accounts AND access for individual accounts 
- use pam mkdir module to create the home directories
- group accounts have a corresponding group 
- put group members into those groups, to allow them to access the
  group directory (via samba, see below) 
- install samba server to present the indivudal and group
  directories. 


- allow both group users and individual users to access the jupyterhub
  server 

- but only the gorup users are part of nbgrader 


- think about where to install the nbgrader repo, and fix access
  rights correspondingly. This is not well done at the moment; if we
  need to trun from repo (and not pip, we need to decide on a better
  place) 


* Notes for releasing material 



** Lectures 

- Copy the notebooks and support files into the gp1 group directories 

** emacs setup 



* At lecture time 

** once members are clear 

- add them to the whitelist of jupyter 

- do NOT add to nbgrader list 

** once groups are clear 

- add email addresses  to group list?  in order to send feedback ? 
- somehow collect IRB accounts? emails? 

- gp1_16_xx
